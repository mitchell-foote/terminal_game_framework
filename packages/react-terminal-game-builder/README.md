# React Terminal Game Builder

react-terminal-game-builder is a lightweight react-based framework for creating simple terminal games. These games run in a normal browser, and have the appearance of a terminal. See the Github page for the full information. 

## Installation

react-terminal-game-builder is installed through your favorite package manager, with few dependencies. 
```
npm install react-terminal-game-builder
```
The module was written in typescript, and types are included, so you don't need a sepearte package for that. You can specifically access those types by importing them.
```
import {Types} from 'react-terminal-game-builder'
```
You can then specify the types by using `Types.OptionTypes` or `Types.GameComponentProps`, etc, etc. 

Once you have that, you're ready to start using the framework!
